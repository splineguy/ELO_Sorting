Below is a sample **README.md** you can adapt for your own GitHub repository. It explains what the project does, how to set it up, and how to use it. Feel free to customize wording or structure as needed.

# Interactive Movie Ratings with Elo

This repository contains a Python script that implements a **menu-driven, Elo-based** rating system for movies. You can load movie titles from a text file, load existing Elo ratings from a JSON file, perform pairwise comparisons between random movie pairs, update the ratings accordingly, and save your progress to JSON for future sessions.

## Features

1. **Load Movies from TXT**  
   Read a list of movies from a plain-text file where each line represents a movie title.

2. **Load/Save Ratings from/to JSON**  
   Maintain a persistent dictionary of `{movie: elo_rating}`, so you can resume partial progress any time.

3. **Menu-Driven**  
   A clear command-line menu guides you through all operations:
   - **(1)** Read movies from a TXT file  
   - **(2)** Read ratings from a JSON file  
   - **(3)** Begin pairwise comparisons and choose your preferred movie in each matchup  
   - **(4)** Save your current ratings to JSON  
   - **(5)** Print out current rankings (with an option to specify how many top movies to view)  
   - **(q)** Quit

4. **Elo Rating System**  
   Each time you pick a “winner” in a comparison, the script updates the winner’s rating up and the loser’s rating down according to the Elo formula. Upsets (lower-rated movie winning) cause larger rating swings, while matches that go as “expected” cause smaller changes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+ (earlier versions may also work, but 3.7+ is recommended)
- No third-party dependencies are required—only the standard Python library.

## Setup

1. **Clone this Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **(Optional) Create a Virtual Environment**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
   # or on Windows:
   # .\env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Requirements**  
   There are no external libraries needed, but if you plan to add any, you can specify them in a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`. For now, this project uses just the Python standard library.

## Usage

1. **Create a Text File**  
   Create a file named `movies.txt` (or another name) in the same directory, with one movie title per line. For example:

   ```
   The Matrix
   Inception
   Spider-Man
   Ghostbusters
   ```

2. **Run the Script**  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   You’ll see a menu with the following options:

   ```
   MENU:
     1. Read movies from TXT file
     2. Read ratings from JSON file
     3. Begin pairwise comparisons
     4. Save current rankings to JSON
     5. Print current list with scores sorted
     q. Quit
   ```

3. **Load Movies**  
   - Choose **1** to load your movie list from `movies.txt`.  
   - Any movie not yet in the rating dictionary is assigned a **default Elo rating** (e.g., 1000).

4. **(Optional) Load Existing Ratings**  
   - If you have a `ratings.json` file from a previous session, choose **2**.  
   - This merges those stored ratings into the in-memory rating dictionary.

5. **Begin Pairwise Comparisons**  
   - Choose **3** to compare random pairs. When asked:
     ```
     Which movie do you prefer?
       1) Movie A (rating: 1000)
       2) Movie B (rating: 1000)
     Choose 1 or 2 (or 'q' to stop):
     ```
     Type `1` or `2`, and the script updates the Elo ratings.

6. **Save Current Ratings**  
   - Choose **4** to save your ratings out to `ratings.json` (or another chosen filename).

7. **Print Current Ranking**  
   - Choose **5** to see a sorted list of your movies by rating. You can specify how many top movies to display.

8. **Quit**  
   - Type **q** to exit the program. You can pick up where you left off by loading `ratings.json` next time.

## Example

Here’s a small sample interaction (simplified):

```
MENU:
  1. Read movies from TXT file
  2. Read ratings from JSON file
  3. Begin pairwise comparisons
  4. Save current rankings to JSON
  5. Print current list with scores sorted
  q. Quit
Choose an option: 1
Enter TXT filename [movies.txt]: 
Loaded 4 movies from movies.txt.
Now have 4 total movies in the system.

MENU:
  1. Read movies from TXT file
  2. ...
Choose an option: 3

Beginning pairwise comparisons. Type 'q' to exit this mode.

Which movie do you prefer?
  1) The Matrix (rating: 1000)
  2) Inception (rating: 1000)
Choose 1 or 2 (or 'q' to stop): 1
You chose 'The Matrix'. Elo updated!

Which movie do you prefer?
  1) Spider-Man (rating: 1000)
  2) Ghostbusters (rating: 1000)
Choose 1 or 2 (or 'q' to stop): q

Returning to menu...
```
